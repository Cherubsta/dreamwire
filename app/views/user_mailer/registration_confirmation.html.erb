	A great dream can inspire you and reveal parts of yourself previously unknown. Like any mind or health practice, dream exploration takes discipline and training.
</p>

<p><em>Dreamwire is all about making it easier:</em></p>

<h4>Mobile is there when you wake up</h4>
<div>
	With our new mobile interface, you can quickly record a dream (from your iPhone, iPod, iPad, or Android device) without leaving your bed.
</div>

<h4>An image speaks a thousand words</h4>
<div>
	Beautiful artwork and photographs can stir emotions and help you remember a dream.  Dreamwire makes it simple to match your dream to a symbolic image.
</div>

<h4>The possibilities are in your dreams</h4>
<div>
	We want to make your dreaming experience even better, so reach out to us (support@dreamwire.co) if you have anything to share.

	Truly,<br />
	Dreamwire team
