<p>Hi<!-- <%#= @user.name.split[0] %> -->,</p>
<p>
	Through the noise and confusion, you discovered dreamwire. Let's begin tapping the unconscious...
</p>
<strong>Dreams are a new science.</strong>
<div>
	 About a third of life is spent asleep and dreaming. That's a big slice, but it's not <em>all</em> <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/dfb12da75a3d" target="_blank">wasted</a>. Different types of exploration like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_LaBerge" target="_blank">lucid dreaming</a> have been around, but these practices take time and discipline. Still, we're no closer to deciphering dreams than we are to understanding the vast universe. Let's set out to change that.
</div>
<br />
<strong>A photo's worth a thousands words.</strong>
<div>
	What if you could wake up one day and <em>see</em> your dream...? The images of dreams are reflections of your waking life plus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes" target="_blank">symbols</a> engrained within you. Dreamwire lets you discover these images and reflect on them in your journal of dreams. Think of it as taking a picture to save a memorable moment, yet the camera is in your dream. This is only the beginning.
</div>
<br />
<strong>The impossible is possible.</strong>
<div>
	It's no mystery that some of the biggest <a href="http://dreamtraining.blogspot.com/2010/12/inventions-that-came-in-dreams-largest.html" target="_blank">scientific, musical,</a> and <a href="http://blog.dreamwire.co/post/41705965123/ice-cream-branding-in-the-flavor-of-dreams" target="_blank">artistic</a> breakthroughs came in the form of a dream. These are the kinds of gems that dreamwire will help you find and hold on to. 
</div>
<br />
<div>
	 Like you, we're fairly new at this and just as curious. We don't have all the answers, but we know they're there, in our dreams, waiting to be uncovered.
</div>
<br />
<p>
	For the inspiring ones,
