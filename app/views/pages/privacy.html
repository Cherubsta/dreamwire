<div class="menuprofile margin-bottom">
  <p class="margin-top">
    We understand that dreams are a personal experience, and some dreams are meant to remain completely private.  Our main goal is to keep your dreams secure and our systems up to date with the latest technology.
  </p>
  <p class="margin-top">
    When you save a dream on Dreamwire, you are given the option to make it private or public. By default, the dream will save as a private. Private dreams are accessible to only you, when signed into your account. A public dream may be shared with others and may be viewable by other dreamwire members on dreamwire's live feed page (LiveWire).  
  </p>
  <p class="margin-top">
    All of your dreams (public and private) are stored on your home page, which only you have access to by signing in with your username (or email) and password. Your dreams are owned by YOU.

  Dreamwire Terms of Service & Privacy Policy
</h3>
<article class="menuprofile">
  <p>This is a legally binding contract between you and Dark Matter Developers (the creators of Dreamwire) Please make sure you read it, because it is important. We’ve tried to make it as clear as possible, but we welcome your feedback to <a href="mailto:support@dreamwire.co?subject=Terms%20of%20Service">support@dreamwire.co</a> if you have suggestions or questions.</p>

  <h3 class="margin-top margin-bottom">1. Definitions</h3>

  <p>We’re going to use some shorthand to make this easier to read. When we say “site,” we mean dreamwire.co, the Dreamwire app, and the services offered through the site. When we say “we,” “us,” or “our,” we mean Dark Matter Developers, LLC, a Virginia corporation. When we say “your content,” we mean any text, sound, graphics or other material which you post, upload, or otherwise share on the site; similarly, when we say "Dreamwire content,” we mean the copyrightable text, sound, graphics, and other material owned by Dark Matter Developers, LLC. And when we say “terms,” we mean these terms of service.</p>

  <h3 class="margin-top margin-bottom">2. Accepting these terms</h3>

  <p>Please read these terms before using the site. <em>If you do not agree to these terms, you may not register for the site.</em> If we make material changes to these terms, we’ll let you know either through the site or via email (at the email address you provide). If you do not agree to those changes, you may send a request to cancel your account to <a href="mailto:support@dreamwire.co?subject=Terms%20of%20Service">support@dreamwire.co</a>. If we do not hear from you within ten days, the revised terms <em>will</em> apply to you. </p>

  <h3 class="margin-top margin-bottom">3. Privacy policy</h3>

  <p>When you register with the site, you will be asked to provide certain personal information, including your name and email address. We will store your personal information, but will not share it with any third parties, except as necessary to provide the services offered. For example, we may store your personal information along with your files and data on a third party server such as Amazon Web Services. We also use your personal information to provide the services you request, send you notifications, and respond to customer support requests. You can access and change your personal information or cancel your account by logging in to your account settings page.</p>

  <p>We may be required to disclose your personal information in order to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>comply with the law or legal process;</li>
    <li>protect or defend our rights or property, or the rights or property of others;</li>
    <li>enforce these terms; or</li>
    <li>respond to claims that the content of any material on our system violates the rights of others.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If we must disclose your personal information in order to comply with the law or legal process, we will inform you (at the email address you provide) as soon as practicable, provided that it is lawful for us to do so.</p>

  <p>We will also aggregate user information and perform statistical analyses of the collective behavior of our members and visitors, to measure overall demographics, and to analyze how to improve our service. We may share this information with third parties (such as Google Analytics), but such aggregate information does not contain personal information other than IP addresses. In addition, we may compile and disclose aggregate information about our users for promotional or other purposes. For example, we might want to disclose that a certain percentage of our users are located within a particular geographic area or log dreams most frequently in the mornings.</p>

  <p>We use session and login cookies, which help us keep track of when a person is logged in and determine the content or sites users link to, and which services people use. We will also capture login timestamps, and usage statistics, as well as IP addresses.</p>

  <p>We will communicate with you via email, to the email address you provide to us. Some communications, such as emails informing you of new features, may be unsubscribed to via the unsubscribe link in the email. If you would like to cease all communications from us, you send an email to <a href="mailto:support@dreamwire.co?subject=Terms%20of%20Service">support@dreamwire.co</a> and we can work things out like civilized human beings.</p>

  <h3 class="margin-top margin-bottom">4. Permitted users</h3>

  <p>Dreamwire is designed for use by mature persons (most adults), which typically means you must be thirteen years of age or older to use it. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of thirteen, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under the age of thirteen, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@dreamwire.co?subject=COPPA">support@dreamwire.co</a>. When you use the site, you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to form a binding contract with us, and are doing so by your agreement to these terms.</p>

  <h3 class="margin-top margin-bottom">5. Copyright and intellectual property</h3>

  <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">We own our stuff; you own yours.</span></p>

  <p>You retain ownership of all content you post, upload to, or otherwise share on the site. However, by posting, uploading, or sharing your content, you grant us a non-exclusive, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to access, use, and display your content in connection with the site and services we provide to you. This license permits us to perform the services that you registered for; for example, it permits us to store your content on redundant data servers, but it <em>does not</em> permit us to sell your content to advertisers or any other third party, nor does it transfer the copyright to us. This license ends when you delete the material or your account.</p>

  <p>Photographs uploaded through third party companies (such as 500px.com) are owned by the third party company and the photographers or artists thereof.</p>

  <p>In addition, the site provides features that allow you to share your content with others. There are many things that others may do with that content, including copying it, modifying it, and re-sharing it. So, please consider carefully what you choose to share and with whom; we take no responsibility for that activity.</p>

  <p>All Dreamwire content, the selection, compilation, arrangement and presentation of all materials, and the overall design of the site are copyrighted by us, and are protected by US and international laws. Use of our content without our express prior written permission is strictly prohibited. </p>

  <p>Dreamwire.co and the Dreamwire logo are (or soon will be) trademarks or registered trademarks of Dark Matter Developers, LLC, in the United States and other foreign countries. Our trademarks may not be used in connection with any product or service without our express written permission.</p>

  <h3 class="margin-top margin-bottom">6. <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr></h3>

  <p>Dreamwire deals with copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (<abbr>DMCA</abbr>).</p>

  <p>You may not post, upload, or otherwise place any content or information on the site that belongs to a third party, unless you have the legal right to do so.  If you believe that any such information or content has been posted on the site, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the designated agent at the address below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
    <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.</li>
    <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material.</li>
    <li>Contact information for the notifying party, including name, address, telephone number, and email address.</li>
    <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
    <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Upon notification of claimed infringement, we will respond expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity. We will also notify the person who posted, uploaded, or otherwise placed the allegedly infringing material on the site that we have removed or disabled access to such material.</p>

  <p>If you believe that material has been removed improperly, you must send a written (or digital, see email link below) counter notification to the agent, and include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A physical or electronic signature.</li>
    <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</li>
    <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.</li>
    <li>Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which we may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original notification or an agent of such person.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Upon receipt of a counter notification complying with these requirements, we will promptly provide the original reporter with a copy of the counter notification, and inform that person that we may replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it if we do not receive notice within ten business days that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue.</p>

  <h3 class="margin-top margin-bottom">9. Disclaimer of warranties</h3>

  <p>We will strive to prevent interruptions to the service and be good stewards of your data. However, the site and our services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not make any warranty that the site or our services will meet your requirements, or that the services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free, or that defects, if any, will be corrected. You understand that you download from or otherwise obtain content or services through the site at your own discretion and risk.</p>

  <h3 class="margin-top margin-bottom">10. Limitations of liability</h3>

  <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, our officers, directors, employees, members, partners, agents, and suppliers, and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members, shareholders, partners, and agents, from any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the site, including but not limited to your violation of this agreement. We may, at our sole discretion, assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.

  <p>We may at any time decide to alter, amend, modify, or terminate the site, any functionality or portion of it, all in our sole discretion, and you understand that there is no guarantee that the site or any portion or functionality of it will continue to operate or be available for any particular period of time.</p>

You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of your use of the site or these terms must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or it shall be forever barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the contrary.</p> 
  <p>If any provision contained in these terms is determined unenforceable, then such provision will be severed and replaced with a new provision that most closely reflects the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these terms will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of these terms shall be effective except pursuant to a written instrument signed by us expressly waiving compliance, and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose stated in such writing.</p>
  <p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these terms and/or your use of the site. You may not assign any right, interest, or benefit provided under these terms or through the site without our express prior written consent. These terms set forth the entire agreement between you and us, and supersede any and all prior communications, agreements and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and us with respect to the site and our services.</p>
  <p>A printed version of these terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these terms and/or your use of the site to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</p>
